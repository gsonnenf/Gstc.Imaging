"If it's a device-independent bitmap you want, then the function to use is Create­DIB­Section. The simplest use of this function creates a device-independent bitmap and gives you a pointer to the in-memory pixel buffer. You can then manipulate the pixel buffer directly, say, by memcpying the bytes from your original buffer.
The fancier use of this function creates a device-independent bitmap around existing memory. The memory needs to be in a file mapping object, either a file mapping object created from a file or (more often) a file mapping object created from the page file (in other words, a shared memory block). You can then specify the byte offset within the file mapping at which the pixel buffer starts. In this case, the memory is not copied; the memory in the file mapping object is the backing memory for the bitmap. If you modify the bitmap, then the contents of the file mapping object change; if you modify the contents of the file mapping object, you modify the bitmap."
